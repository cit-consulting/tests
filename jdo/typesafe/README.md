Tests for the DataNucleus JDO-extension Typesafe query mechanism.

### Eclipse Integration

The [m2e-apt](https://github.com/jbosstools/m2e-apt) connector can be used to do the annotation processing configuration on Eclipse based on the pom settings. Notice that the JDT APT can't use processor from the workspace so you must install your changes to your local repo in order for them to work.
